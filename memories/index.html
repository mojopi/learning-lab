    <div id="description">
        <p>In this program, sprout & co worked with Emma Daniels, a 7th grade English teacher, to design a storytelling program meant to help young people surface and share stories from their pasts. </p>

        <p>In this program, we looked at great examples of short, personal stories. We watched comeplleing examples of spoken word, stories made in scratch, and differnet kinds of scrapbooks. A favorite example, was a <a href="https://storycorps.org/animation/miss-devine/">short animation</a> about a Sunday school teacher named Miss Devine.</p>

        <p>In the end, young people used various forms to share stories about their pasts. Many people used <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a> to make animations, others made flipbooks, scrapbooks, and slideshows. The pictures below are snapshots from different projects. Some are screenshots of scratch projects, some are images of physical projects (e.g. scrapbooks) that people made.</p>
