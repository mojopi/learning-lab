                    <hr>
                    <p>We built, tested, and compared three different water filters to see which worked best, using natural materials including gravel, pebbles, fine sand, and activated charcoal. We also tested water samples from the school’s tap and the Mystic River for presence of heavy metals and other contaminants.</p>

                    <p>We followed an experimental protocol to make our first attempt at making plastic from banana peels and adapted that protocol for use with potatoes. We also collected plastic water cups from the school cafeteria to create recycled chandeliers.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We investigated different ways of visualizing the amount of water wasted when a faucet leaks or a pipe drips. We used Scratch to create animations representing this data, collected water bottles and built a sculpture to represent this data, and also wired up a water sensor which, when placed under your faucet, will light up to tell you if you are contributing to water waste.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We all experimented with different cornstarch-based recipes for making biodegradable plastics to help solve the problem of over-packaging. With those materials, we then split up into three different groups looking into more scientific investigations around the best bioplastic recipe, art-making with this new material, and the prototyping of a biobox we hope Amazon will consider using to minimize the extreme over-packaging for which they are currently guilty.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We worked to create a cornstarch-based bioplastic that could help to address the issue of food waste, by using excess food. We tried multiple recipes and refined our approach to create a material that was smooth and strong. Eventually, we hope to incorporate other types of foods which are more commonly wasted.</p>
